## 2-DOF_Manipulator
This code is for graphical representation of `2_DOF` manipulator.
## Used libraries 
> Numpy      
> Matplotlib
## Discription 
In this code random joints and link_length values are generated and applied to matplotlib to represent it as length of ringid links and joints values.
## Example
_Generated Random Data_
joint0_angle = 231.0 degrees      
joint1_angle = 74.7 degrees     
End Effector at x = 7.6 y = -59.1
